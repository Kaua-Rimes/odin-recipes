    <p>A Brazillian dessert made with condensed milk, chocolate fudge, and broken cookies.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cans of sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 large package of a plain tea cookies <br>(about 15 ounces), broken into
            medium <br>size </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ingredients in a large pot over medium/low heat and cook <br>
            for about 15 minutes, stirring often to avoid it from sticking on the <br>
            bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture starts thickening slightly (you should see a few bubbles <br>
            popping and the bottom of the pan when stirring), turn off the heat and <br>
            let it rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir half of the cookies into the chocolate mixture and combine.</li>
            <li>Stir in the rest of the cookies and spread the dessert onto a buttered <br>
            rimmed baking sheet, flattening on top with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for 2 hours, cur into squares and roll them into sugar.</li>
        </ol>
